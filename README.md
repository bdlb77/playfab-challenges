# PlayFab & XR Server Challenge Content for Non Gaming

_âš  This is a hackathon project with no support or quality guarantee_

This project is used to demonstrate how one can utilize [PlayFab](https://playfab.com/) and [XR Server](https://www.xrserver.com/) to integrate realtime interaction and LiveOps into your applications to drive User Engagement.

## Guidance

This Project consists of 3 main sections:

1. [`app/`](./app//README.md) - A boilerplate app that can be used as your
   implementation for the Challenges that are presented. This app has all
   playFab and XRServer implementations removed as to give opportunity to
   implement and learn by building out an example similar to the concept
   of a `hackoverflow`
1. [`solutions/`](./solutions/README.md) - This section includes a finished solution as a way to give
   guidance and examples to those who get stuck.
1. [`challenges/`](./challenges/Challenge00.md) - A series of challenges that will walk the user through tasks
  that can be completed to better understand how to build out the app but more
  importantly, how to interact with PlayFab and XRServer. The link will take you to the introduction page of the challenge series.
